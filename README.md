This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. 
The system suggests movies to users based on their past preferences and similarities with other users' preferences. 
By leveraging machine learning algorithms, it provides personalized recommendations to enhance user experience.

Features:-
Collaborative Filtering: Utilizes collaborative filtering algorithms to recommend movies based on user preferences and similarities with other users.
Personalized Recommendations: Generates personalized movie recommendations for each user, enhancing user satisfaction and engagement.
Data Visualization: Visualizes user-item interactions and recommendation results for better understanding and analysis.
Scalability: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently, ensuring scalability and performance.


Technologies Used:-
Python: Programming language used for implementing the recommendation algorithms and system functionalities.
Pandas: Library for data manipulation and analysis, employed for handling and processing movie rating data.
Scikit-learn: Machine learning library utilized for implementing collaborative filtering algorithms.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: Libraries used for data visualization, enabling the visualization of user-item interactions and recommendation results.
